## Here is the link: https://jarjardinks.github.io/simple-js-app/

## Description:
- To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
- This is my first project, ever.

### Tools:

- I have implemented Bootsrap for the modal, navbar, and general styling. The list is ordered with bootstrap as well.
- I have implemented jQuery, however I have limited the use of it due to popular demand. 
- The task runner GULP is installed in this project. Allowing easy workflow with minifying css and js. Also giving both a sourcemap.

## Examlpe:
- If by chance site is down here is a default picture. However, you cant play with the functionality.

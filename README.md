# Pokemon Index

## Here is the link: https://jarjardinks.github.io/simple-js-app/
## Description:
- This is a pokemon index project I am building, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Tools:
- I have implemented Bootsrap for the modal, navbar, and general styling. The list is ordered with bootstrap as well.
- I have implemented jQuery, however I have limited the use of it due to popular demand.
